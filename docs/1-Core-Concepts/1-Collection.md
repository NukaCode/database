# Collection



## Tap property of collection
If you have a collection you can tap a relationship of an object in the collection to get a new collection of the relationship data. You can also tap a property of the object in the collection to get a new collection of all instances of that property in that collection.

```php
  $users = User::all();
  $actions = $users->roles->actions;
  $roleNames = $users->roles->name;
```
  
In this example, $actions would return a collection of all actions attached to all roles attached to the users.
`$roleNames` would return a collection of every role name for each role the users are attached to.

## Run method on collection
You can run a method on the entire collection such as `save()`, or `delete()`.  If you wanted to delete an entire collection you could do
```php
  $users->roles->delete();
```
  
## Searching a collection
If you need to return a specific set of objects from a collection you can call the `getWhere()` method on the collection. This is a magic method used to search the collection.
Get where can take several extra parameters by changing the method name.

### Method name convention
getWhere[ in | between | like | null | many ] [not] [ first | last ](mixed $column, mixes $value)

### Method parameters
Method Name | Parameters |Result
----------- | ---------- | --------
getWhere         | STRING $column<br />STRING $value            | This will return all object in the collection that have the column `$column` that equals `$value`.
getWhereIn       | STRING $column<br />STRING $values            | This will return all objects in the collection where the column `$column` is in the array of `$values`.
getWhereBetween  | STRING $column<br />STRING $values            | This will return all objects in the collection where the column `$column` is between `$values[0]` and `$values[1]`.
getWhereLike     | STRING $column<br />STRING $value            | This will return all objects in the collection where column `$column` contains the sub string `$value`.
getWhereNull     | STRING $column            | This will return all objects in the collection where column `$column` is null.
getWhereMany     | ARRAY $columns => $values | This will return all objects in the collection that match all where statements in the passed in array.

### Method Modifiers
Method Name | Parameters |Result
----------- | ---------- | --------
getWhereNot      | STRING $column          | This will return all objects in the collection 
                 | STRING $value           | that column `$column` is other than $value.  
                                           | (The not operator can be added to all methods 
                                           | to invert the results)
getWhereFirst    | STRING $column          | This will return only the first object in the 
                 | STRING $value           | collection.  (The first operator can be added 
                                           | to all methods to return the first result)
getWhereLast     | STRING $column          | This will return only the last object in the 
                 | STRING $value           | collection.  (The last operator can be added 
                                           | to all methods to return the last result)

### Example
You can also look at `the tests <https://github.com/NukaCode/core/blob/master/tests/spec/NukaCode/Core/Database/CollectionSpec.php>`_ for more examples
```php
  $aColleciton->getWhere('aField','Some Text');
  $aCollection->getWhere('relationship->aField', 'Some Text');
  $aCollection->getWhereNot('relationship->aField', 'Some Text');
```
  
### toSelectArray()
Parameters | Type | Required Default
---------- | ---- | ----------------
$firstOptionText | string | No | 'Select One'
$id | string | No | 'id'
$name | string | No | 'name'

This method takes a standard object from an eloquent call and converts it to an array usable by Laravel's form select method. This is used similarly to the Laravel `toJson()` or `toArray()` methods.
```php
  $users = User::orderByNameAsc()->get()->toSelectArray( 'Select a user', 'uniqueId', 'username');
```
